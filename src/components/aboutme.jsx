            <p>I am a hard-working, thoughtful and enthusiastic individual who seeks and enjoys a challenge. I complete all tasks with accuracy, diligence and enjoyment, aiming to produce the best possible results within any given time frame.</p>
            <p>I have cultured and developed a strong understanding of the testing process. I have had experience working as both a manual and automation engineer, with my daily responsibilities including working with bug databases, test scripts, QA plans and roadmaps, as well as attending meetings with developers and management. I have worked in an agile environment, engaging in scrums and sprint kickoffs.</p>
            <p>As a manual tester, I have always maintained that communication and detail is key. I have strived in mastering bug databases such as Jira and Targetprocess, entering all details such as bug environments, platforms, steps to reproduce and expected behaviours with diligence. I have also encouraged a Behave Driven Development environment, through which all issues are detailed using Gherkin/Cucumber in order to clearly communicate requirements and concerns at any stage to the whole development team.</p>
            <p>Whilst learning automative testing, I have become familiar with Selenium Webdriver and Docker, through which I have gained knowledge in application architecture and hierarchies. I have also begun improving my working knowledge of python and javascript through which to build and maintain tests, as well as developing a solid understanding of Git and the command line. I have also become familiar with using AWS in order to create User Pools with Cognito, S3 buckets and handling user permissions, as well as utilising Postman and the command line in order to perform various API testing.</p>
            <p>Lastly, in my spare time I enjoy keeping fit through running and playing squash, as well as regularly attending the gym. I also have an avid interest in history and computer programming in general. For the latter, I have recently started learning React as to explore different languages, build websites and provide another creative outlet for myself. </p>
