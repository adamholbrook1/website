          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <p>Hi there! My names Adam and I'm a QA Automation Engineer living in Brighton, UK.</p>
          <p>As a graudate from the University of Sussex in History, I have a fine eye for detail and a love of exploration and discovery.</p>
          <p>I am a hard-working, thoughtful and enthusiastic individual who seeks and enjoys a challenge.</p>
          <h3>Work</h3>
          <p>I am a confident and competent QA Engineer, trained in both manual and automation testing practices. I approach problems in a Behave Driven Development learning style, and have become proficient in both python and javascript testing suites, having built both of my own!</p>
          <p>I have gained skills in API testing, AWS integrations, Selenium Webdriver and Cypress test suites, continuous integration/deployments and containerised environments through Docker. I also have experience as a team lead and mentor to both staff and those in work experience. I have cultivated a love for teaching, and engage with documentation for companies to train with and use as well as developing learning plans for new starters and current staff.</p>
          <p>I have a ‘can-do’ approach to anything, and love discussing plans and prototypes with brand new technology and software to discover the best way of doing things.</p>
          <h3>Outside of work</h3>
          <p>When I'm not working you'll probaly find me being a Dungeon Master, an archer, a model painter, running or cycling over the Sussex Downs, playing games, learning and reading, or chilling with my wife and cat. The cat's name is Tiberius, but we call him Tibbs or Tibblor for short.</p>
